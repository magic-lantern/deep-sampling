This repository leverages native GitHub functionality to conduct reproducible research platform. Why GitHub? Honestly, because it's well-suited for out-of-the-box use as a reproducible research repository.

If you are a new GitHub user and/or if you'd like to better understand how we leverage GitHub tools for reproducible research, we recommend that you start by reading our [Tutorial](../../wiki/Using-GitHub-as-a-Reproducible-Research-Platform).

We are also in the process of drafting some simple GitHub Reproducible Research (GRR) [guidelines](../../wiki/Our-Reproducible-Repository-Guidelines-%F0%9F%98%83). Please take a look and [let us know what you think](../../issues/new?assignees=magic-lantern&labels=wiki&template=wiki.md&title=Wiki%3A+Briefly+describe+task).

Let us know if you decide to use this framework, we'd love to feature you as a collaborator on our [wiki](../../wiki) and hear more about how you implemented this framework within your research. We also encourage you to keep the Abra-Collaboratory badge (shown above) on your repo as an indicator of your intent to conduct reproducible research.
